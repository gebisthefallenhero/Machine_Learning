# Machine_Learning
This is a repostiy of the code that I have done for data science and 
machine learning.
### Refactored_Py_DS_ML_Bootcamp-master
These are class prodjects
* Linear Regression - A linear regression of the Boston Data set 
* Logistic Regression- A logistic regression, random forrest, and support 
vector machine approach combined for the kaggle titanic data set competition.
Additionally a feed forward ANN approach was taken at the end.
* Support Vector Machines- A SVM approach to the iris data set

### Personal Prodjects
* Bike-Sharing-Dataset A predictive project for the bike sharing data set
from UCI.
* College_Recuitment - A classification prodject of a data set found on
kaggle for college admitance

### TensorFlow_Files/ANNS
Contains the final prodject for the machine learning course I took. Using a
ANN to predict if someone would default on their loan. Focused on feature 
engineering.
